 Correlation in 1D and 2D using SPM code from Todd Pataky's spm1d functions.
 These functions are computing figures of level 1 and level 2 correlations, using a non parametric approach (permutation tests) for 1D (curves) and 2D continuum (wavelet maps, pressure data).

For more details about the exact computations, the readers is ask to refer to the origin of the functions on the spm1d.org website :

This package of functions has been used in several published articles but the functions has not been peer reviewed.
